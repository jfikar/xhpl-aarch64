# xhpl-aarch64 
## Compiled [HPL (High-Performance Linpack Benchmark)](https://netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/) for Linux on ARM64 (AARCH64)

[HPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks) is used by [top500.org](https://www.top500.org/) to rank the world's fastest supercomputers by [FLOPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS) (floating-points operations per second). It can also be used to test the stability of your CPU, CPU frequency throttling (you either observe the actual frequency or determine it by lower FLOPs), CPU cache, RAM, and the power supply since HPL is quite demanding and also performs the result verification (see PASSED/FAILED below). On the other hand, HPL is not ideal for testing the maximum temperature. The CPU gets quite hot during the calculation phase, but cools down during the verification phase.

The best FLOPs for ARM64 (probably for other archs as well) are usually obtained using [OpenBLAS library](https://www.openblas.net/). However, it is advisable not to use the library compiled by your distribution. For better results, compile it yourself or use the provided binaries. Alternatively, one can utilize [BLIS libraries](https://github.com/flame/blis), [ARM Performance Libraries](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries), or any other BLAS implementation.

## How to compile yourself

### Compile OpenBLAS
```
wget https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.26.tar.gz
tar xvf v0.3.26.tar.gz
cd OpenBLAS-0.3.26
export NO_SHARED=1
export TARGET=CORTEXA53
NO_FORTRAN=1 NUM_THREADS=8 USE_OPENMP=1 make -j$(nproc)
make PREFIX=${HOME}/openblas install
```
The possible TARGETs are listed in file the `TargetList.txt`. For our purpose, the relevant options include: *ARMV8*, *CORTEXA53*, *CORTEXA55*, *CORTEXA57*, *CORTEXA72*, *CORTEXA73*, and *CORTEXX1* (good for CORTEX-A76, A77, and A78?). Not setting TARGET will result in an automatic detection.

We no longer need the shared libraries (so) as we link OpenBLAS statically to the final xhpl binary, the option `NO_SHARED=1` takes care of this.

It is also posible to use `DYNAMIC_ARCH=1` to compile all the supported CPUs into one library. Specify the maximum number of threads by using `NUM_THREADS=8`.

```
wget https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.26.tar.gz
tar xvf v0.3.26.tar.gz
cd OpenBLAS-0.3.26
export NO_SHARED=1
export TARGET=ARMV8
export DYNAMIC_ARCH=1
NO_FORTRAN=1 NUM_THREADS=8 USE_OPENMP=1 make -j$(nproc)
make PREFIX=${HOME}/openblas install
```
### Alternatively compile BLIS
```
wget https://github.com/flame/blis/archive/refs/tags/0.9.0.tar.gz
tar xvf 0.9.0.tar.gz
cd blis-0.9.0
./configure -p ${HOME}/blis --disable-shared -t openmp auto
make -j${nproc}
make check
make install
ln -s ${HOME}/blis/lib/libblis.a ${HOME}/blis/lib/libopenblas.a
```
The *auto* option should compile the right library, but the detection algorithm might be inaccurate. You can view all the available possibilities by using the command `ls config`. For ARM64 there are *cortexa53*, *cortexa57*, *firestorm* (Apple A14, M1), *thunderx2* (Neoverse N1), and *generic*. Recently, there is also support for configuration families. In that case, use *arm64*, and all posibilities are compiled, with the correct one chosen at runtime. However, the detection might still be incorrect. Select the right library and link it to the HPL. 

### Compile HPL
```
sudo apt install -y libopenmpi-dev
wget https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/hpl-2.3.tar.gz
tar xvf hpl-2.3.tar.gz
cd hpl-2.3
```
#### With OpenBLAS
```
LDFLAGS=-L${HOME}/openblas/lib CFLAGS="-pthread -fopenmp" ./configure
make -j$(nproc)
```
#### With BLIS
```
LDFLAGS=-L${HOME}/blis/lib CFLAGS="-pthread -fopenmp" ./configure
make -j$(nproc)
```

The resulting binary is `hpl-2.3/testing/xhpl`

It turns out that the OpenBLAS binary for *CORTEX-A53* and *CORTEX-A55* are the same  (no more since OpenBLAS-0.3.25). And *CORTEX-A57* and *CORTEX-A72* are identical as well. This is because HPL utilizes only a limited set of functions ([dgemm](https://netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d1/d54/group__double__blas__level3_gaeda3cbd99c8fb834a60a6412878226e1.html), [daxpy](https://netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/de/da4/group__double__blas__level1_ga8f99d6a644d3396aa32db472e0cfc91c.html),  dcopy, dgemv, dger, dscal, dswap, dtrsm, dtrsv, and idamax) from OpenBLAS, and these functions are identical for these specified targets.

## Using precompiled binaries

As mentioned earlier, the *CORTEX-A53* and *CORTEX-A55* are the same (no more since OpenBLAS-0.3.25) and similarly, the *CORTEX-A57* and *CORTEX-A72* are identical.

You need an openmpi library, even if you intend to run it in OpenMP mode, which will automatically utilize all available cores. If you wish to use MPI, you can modify the values of P and Q in the `HPL.dat` file.
```
sudo apt install openmpi-bin
```
Additionally, you need to create a `HPL.dat` text file, which may look something like this:
```

8           memory alignment in double (> 0)
```

The parameter `Ns` is the size of the square matrix Ns Ã— Ns, and the memory consumption is directly proportional to Ns^2. Ns=20000 needs around 4GB RAM, for 8GB use 28000, for 2GB use 14000, and for 1GB 10000. Try to use all the RAM as it improves the FLOPs, but you should avoid swapping as it drastically decreased FLOPs.

| RAM (GB)  | optimal Ns |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0.5| 7000   |
| 1  | 10000  |
| 2  | 14000  |
| 4  | 20000  |
| 8  | 28000  |
| 16 | 40000  |
| 32 | 57000  |

There is [a formula](https://github.com/open-power/op-benchmark-recipes/blob/master/standard-benchmarks/HPL/Linpack_HPL.dat_tuning.md) to calculate the N.

The parameters NB determines the size of the blocks used for calculation. Its optimization is a bit of guesswork. It probably depends a lot on CPU caches and RAM speed. So in the example file you have 12 different NBs. The HPL will run for all of them and you can choose the one with the highest FLOPs.

Then just run `xhpl`. Sample output:

```
Sometimes instead of **PASSED** you can see **FAILED**, which means that the residual sums are higher than expected and your CPU calculated the result wrongly. This can be due to too high CPU frequency, not enough CPU voltage, or due to overheating.
Often the computer may also crash or restart. Which is also a sign of instability.

### Huge Pages
The Huge Pages can improve your FLOPs by approximately 10%. The easiest method is to enable the Transparent Huge Pages (THP) if your kernel supports them. For instance, the official Raspberry Pi kernel has THP disabled for some reason.

```
echo always | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo always | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/use_zero_page
```

If you have additional results, I can include them in the table

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS#Floating-point_operations_per_clock_cycle_for_various_processors) Cortex-A53, A55, A57, A72, and A73 have **4** FLOPs/cycle/core. Cortex-A76, A77, and A78 have **8** FLOPs/cycle/core. So you can check that your ARM is reaching the correct FLOPs as it should.

It is more difficult to to handle big.LITTLE archs as HPL distributes the tasks equally, so the faster cores will have to wait for the slower ones. The easiest is to test separately the big and then the LITTLE cluster using `taskset` to target the needed cores. In this case we will get correct FLOPs for the clusters, but we will not maximally stress the CPU.

### Notes

#### Raspberry Pi 3B+
Uses the aluminium Armor Case with Dual Fan. The thermal throtling can be checked by `vcgencmd get_throttled`. The CPU temperature was under 49C and the thermal throttling was not reached.

#### Raspberry Pi 4
Uses the aluminium Armor Case with Dual Fan. To achieve 1.8GHz on newer boards, you need `arm_boost=1` in `/boot/config.txt`. You can also specify `hdmi_enable_4kp60=1`, which increases the core frequency from 500MHz to 550MHz. The thermal throtling can be checked by `vcgencmd get_throttled`. The CPU temperature was under 62C and the thermal throttling was not reached. The fastest result on all cores was reached BLIS using `BLIS_JC_NT=2 BLIS_IC_NT=1 BLIS_JR_NT=1 BLIS_IR_NT=2`.

#### Raspberry Pi 5
Uses the official cooler with PWM controlled fan. The thermal throtling can be checked by `vcgencmd get_throttled`. The CPU temperature was under 74C (fan speed 6600RPM) and the thermal throttling was not reached.


#### Odroid-HC4

Set the fan speed to the maximum by `sudo systemctl stop fancontrol`. Verify by running `sensors`, you should see around 4500RPM and `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1_enable` should be 0. The CPU temperature is under 63C.

#### Odroid-M1

I used a USB 10cm fan pointed on the passive heatsink. Temperature was under 47C.

Without the fan with just the stock passive heatsink oriented upwards the results are lower and more scattered. It indicates that there was a thermal throttling, even though the `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_cur_freq` still reports the default frequency of 1.992GHz. The GFLOPs with only the passive cooling were 13.23, so the frequency probably dropped to 1.748GHz. The CPU temperature reached 69C.

#### Vim3 

Stock VIM3 active cooling.

`20000   184     2     2             301.54             1.7689e+01`

`20000   200     1     1             970.52             5.4959e+00`


#### Orange Pi 5 Plus 

I used heatsinks on CPU and RAM with a case fan. 

`40000   232     2     4            1666.31             2.5607e+01`

`40000    96     1     1            3177.34             1.3429e+01`

The Single Core (1P/1Q) performance is so nearly ideal that I think there is a lot still on the table. I pulled this from my initial run of 5 NBs. The RK3588 is a very enticing platform, with much higher inter-node communication potential. It already out-performs a 3-node cluster of 8G Pi 4s, and has 5x the networking throughput potential. 

#### Radaxa Rock 5B
It has the same SoC as Orange Pi 5 (RK3588). With stock active fan and Rock's own software [fan-control](https://github.com/pymumu/fan-control-rock5b) it reaches 75C and it looks like thermal throttling. However, the reported frequencies are still the same, they do not decrease (as with Odroid M1). It shows all the time 2352MHz for CPU 4 and 5, and 2304MHz for CPU 6 and 7. Additional cooling is necesary. The stock Radaxa kernel does not have THP support. Rock 5B is performing a slower than Orange Pi 5 with the same SoC. The difference is [DMC (Dynamic Memory Interface)](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/Knowledge/blob/master/articles/Quick_Preview_of_ROCK_5B.md#important-insights-and-suggested-optimisations), which automatically clocks RAM frequency down from 2112MHz to 528MHz (it saves about 0.5-0.6W when idle) and it is not activated in the Orange Pi kernel. To improve the benchmark, do either `echo 25 >/sys/devices/platform/dmc/devfreq/dmc/upthreshold` or `echo performance | sudo tee /sys/class/devfreq/dmc/governor`. The latter is reverted by `echo dmc_ondemand | sudo tee /sys/class/devfreq/dmc/governor`. The newer Radaxa kernel/image implements the firts workaround.
